this is a work in progress general purpose pwa repo for Edward to familiarize with Angular, DOTNET and Ruby on rails. this repo contains shall contain multiple functionalities in the future and will keep expanding

# motivation
upon arrival to Canada, we can hardly adjust the cost value to CAD since we used to live in a HKD environment. in Hong Kong, Tips are generally not required and there is no such thing called GST/HST tax on what we buy. This is a greatest pain point. Moreover there are other needs e.g. inventory management, price comparison, cost management. Ideally all this would require a distributed system with authentication enabled. Although I could code it real quick with some of my favourite tech stack e.g. React, NodeJS, while applying for development jobs in Canada, DOTNET, RUBY on RAILS and Angular are some of the most popular tech stack in the IT industry. Thus, I decide to familiarize myself with these tech-stack
